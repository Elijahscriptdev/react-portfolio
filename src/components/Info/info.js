        I am a recent graduate of Microverse, a remote 
        software development school. For the past nine months, 
        I have spent over 1500 hours learning new tech skills 
        such as Ruby on Rails, Javascript(React), SQL, Postgresql and TDD.
        I communicate eloquently, multitask and collaborate effectively with teams. 
        While I have been privileged to see some projects and tasks through
         successful completion and deployment, I am currently looking for a position 
         as a software developer in a unique
          organization with growth opportunities where my skills and 
          abilities can be fully harnessed and sharpened.
